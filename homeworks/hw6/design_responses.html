						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I found this article quite interesting! I never thought about so many tricks under the interface design. I get to know the optimal speed for  interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms, and it differs between devices, object sizes. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Easing helps to make the movement of the object more natural. It is one of the essential principles of the animation. For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some acceleration or deceleration — just like all live objects in the physical world.</p>
						</li>
