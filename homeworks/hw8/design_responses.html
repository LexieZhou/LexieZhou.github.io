				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I get to know what is a dark pattern, types of dark pattern and its related issues. A dark pattern is a misleading or otherwise deceptive UI/UX decision that tries to exploit human psychology to get users to do things they don’t really want to do. Creating Dark Patterns is not a good, ethical practice and how designers should be responsible for their actions and focus on creating transparency with the users instead of manipulating them.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Disguised Ads. We see a lot of disguised Ads in all kinds of websites. I always find them annoying but it is the first time I actually think about it and also from the UX design perspective.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
