        <em>Major: CS | Minor: Finance | Year: Junior</em>
        <p>Hiiii! I am Lexie Zhou, a CS major junior exchange student from the University of Hong Kong.
           Growing and always willing to try new things, I currently want to further my CS study in the U.S. after undergrad 
           and explore a career as a web developer because it is pretty interesting! 
           Also, I am a music, movie, travelling and dessert lover :)</p>

            <h2> Reading Response </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The hiarachy, content, intent are specially designed to fit the audiance's taste.
                    While we are checking apps, we can develop design eyes since there are always design rules and tricks behind them.

                    I like the <strong>"Breaking down the app"</strong> part most. Because it tells me how to analyze design reasons
                    behind the appearance, which I have never noticed before. Besides, the explanation and animation are quite lively.
                </li>

                    Next time you’re sitting in a Lyft or waiting on a friend, open up an app and think through the reasons why 
                    the designers chose to design it that way. By routinely analyzing other apps, you’ll develop your product thinking 
                    and get better at designing apps yourself.
